<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) is a data-driven scientific discipline. However, public data on CEA is scarce. 
  Moreover, more and more scientific journals and grants require data dissemination. The CEAOD initiative, started in early 2019 
  by <a href="https://www.controlledenvironments.org/">NCERA-101 Committee on Controlled environment Technology and Use</a>, 
  aims to promote data sharing to help accelerate CEA research.
  
  There are 3 pillars in this initiative.
    <ol>
      <li><b>Data format recommendations</b>: this helps researchers collect data following the best practices and then share data in a format that can be consumed easily by other people.</li>
      <li><b>Data repository</b>: this helps researchers to browser datasets and/or contribute your own data easily. This central repository also enhances the discoverability of data and the associated research.</li>
      <li><b>Tools</b>: we also aim to develop tools that make it easier to standardize and share your data as well as tools for common data analysis.</li>
    </ol>
