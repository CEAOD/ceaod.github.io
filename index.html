<h1>About</h1>
<p>
  Controlled Environment Agriculture (CEA) is a data-driven scientific discipline. However, public data on CEA is scarce. 
  Moreover, more and more scientific journals and grants require data dissemination. The CEAOD initiative, started in late 2018 
  by a diverse group of researchers in CEA, aims to promote data sharing to help accelerate CEA research.
  
  There are 3 pillars in this initiative.
    <ul>
      <li><b>Data format recomendations</b>: this helps researchers collect data following the best practices and then share data in a format that can be consumed easily by other people.</li>
      <li><b>Data repository</b>: this helps researchers to browser datasets and/or contribute your own data easily. This central repository also enhances the discoverability of data and the associated research.</li>
      <li><b>Tools</b>: we also aim to develop tools that make it easier to standardize and share your data as well as tools for common data analysis.</li>
    </ul>
</p>

    <h2>Table for environmental data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>High frequency time-series data</li>
      <li>Logged automatically by sensors/actuators</li>
    </ul>

  <p>
    <h2>Table for crop/biological data</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Low frequency time-series data</li>
      <li>Input by humans</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="/assets/images/crop.png" alt="crop data" />
  </p>

  <p>
    <h2>Description file (metadata)</h2>
    <h3>Necessary</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Brief description of data, including date and location of the crop</li>

      <li>Semantics and unit for each attribute</li>

      <li>Data owner and contact info</li>

      <li>Citation if published</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Nice to have</h3>

    <ul>
      <li>Funding source</li>

      <li>Specs of instruments and calibration method used</li>

      <li>Known problems limiting the data use</li>

      <li>Names of data sets related to this set</li>

      <li>[anything available and considered useful to other researchers]</li>
    </ul>
